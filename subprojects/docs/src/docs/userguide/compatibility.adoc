= Compatibility Matrix

The sections below describe Gradle's compatibility with several integrations.
Versions not listed here may or may not work.

== Java
A Java version between 8 and 19 is required to execute Gradle.
Java 20 and later versions are not yet supported.

Java 6 and 7 can still be used for <<building_java_projects.adoc#sec:java_cross_compilation,compilation>>, but are deprecated
for use with testing. Testing with Java 6 and 7 will not be supported in Gradle 9.0.

Any fully supported version of Java can be used for compile or test.
The latest Java version may however only be supported for compile or test but not yet for running Gradle.

For older Gradle versions, please see the table below which Java version is supported by which Gradle release.
