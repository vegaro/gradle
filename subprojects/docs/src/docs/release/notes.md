The Gradle team is excited to announce Gradle @version@.

This release features the support for [persistent Java compiler daemons](#faster-java-compilation) to speed up Java compilation.
Gradle will also use [less memory for dependency resolution](#reduced-memory-consumption).
The effect is significant, particularly for large builds such as Android builds.

Gradle now supports running on Java 20.

For Kotlin DSL, build authors can [try out the Kotlin K2 compiler](#kotlin_k2) for build logic with some limitations.
See the [Kotlin DSL](#kotlin-dsl-improvements) dedicated section for more information.

This release also brings several usability improvements, including better [CodeNarc output](#improved-codenarc-output), a [dry run mode](#dry-run-mode-for-test-execution) for test execution,
improved [output for task options](#group-opposite-boolean-build-and-task-options-together), and upgraded [SSL support](#ssl).

## Upgrade instructions

Switch your build to use Gradle @version@ by updating your wrapper:

`./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=@version@`

See the [Gradle 8.x upgrade guide](userguide/upgrading_version_8.html#changes_@baseVersion@) to learn about deprecations, breaking changes and other considerations when upgrading to Gradle @version@.

### FILL-IN-KEY-AREA improvements

<<<FILL IN CONTEXT FOR KEY AREA>>>
Example:
> The [configuration cache](userguide/configuration_cache.html) improves build performance by caching the result of
> the configuration phase. Using the configuration cache, Gradle can skip the configuration phase entirely when
> nothing that affects the build configuration has changed.

#### FILL-IN-FEATURE
> HIGHLIGHT the usecase or existing problem the feature solves
> EXPLAIN how the new release addresses that problem or use case
> PROVIDE a screenshot or snippet illustrating the new feature, if applicable
> LINK to the full documentation for more details

### Maven toolchain declarations with environment variables are now supported

Using [toolchains](userguide/toolchains.html) is the recommended way of specifying Java versions for JVM projects.
By default, Gradle automatically detects local JRE/JDK installations so no further configuration is required by the user.
One of the auto-detection formats that Gradle supports is Maven Toolchain specification.

With this Gradle release, if you rely on the integration with Maven toolchain definitions, Gradle now supports the use of environment variables placeholders inside `toolchain.xml` files.
The placeholder will be resolved by looking at environment variables known to the Gradle build.

### SSL improvements for non-standard keystores and truststores

Previously, Gradle exhibited limitations when interfacing with non-standard keystores and truststores.
This affected users on Linux systems with FIPS enabled and also Windows users who were storing certificates in the Trusted Root Certification Authorities store.

SSL context creation has been improved to be more aligned with the default implementation and to support these cases.
